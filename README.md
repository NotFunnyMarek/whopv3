# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Discord Access Bot

The `discord-bot` folder contains a minimal bot that links a Discord server with the platform. Install dependencies and configure environment variables using a `.env` file.

Run the bot with:

```bash
cd discord-bot
npm install
node bot.js
```

Invite the bot to your server and execute `/setup` to receive a verification code.

## Client Configuration

The React frontend now contains the Discord application ID directly in the source
code. No additional environment variables are required to run the client.

## Discord OAuth Setup

The Discord OAuth flow expects the following redirect URL:

```
https://<your-domain>/discord-access
```

Add this exact URL to the **Redirects** list in your Discord application's OAuth2 settings. If the URL is missing, Discord will display an `Invalid OAuth2 redirect_uri` error.

For local development you may also include:

```
http://localhost:3000/discord-access
```

Once configured, clicking **Get Access** will redirect to Discord and then back to `/discord-access` with a `code` query parameter. The page must also include a `whop_id` query parameter identifying the target Whop.

The backend requires these environment variables so the OAuth flow can
complete and automatically add the member to your server:

```
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-secret>
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=<bot-token>
```

Ensure they are available to the PHP scripts handling Discord access.
